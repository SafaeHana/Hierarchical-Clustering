# Hierarchical-Clustering
## Problem Statement: 
Consider the dataset “zoo.data” and look at the info in the first five rows. The first 
column denotes the animal name and the last one specifies a high-level class for the corresponding animal. 
Find a solution to the following questions:
- Unique number of high-level class
- Perform agglomerative clustering using the 16 intermediate features 
[ Hint: Refer to the agglomerative clustering (Hierarchical Clustering) module in Scikit learn and 
set the number of clusters appropriately ]
Refer the below link for further documentation: 
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html
- Compute the mean squared error by comparing the actual class and predicted high-level class.
Objective: Perform agglomerative clustering with appropriate MSE value.
